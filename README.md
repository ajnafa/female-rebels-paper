### Abstract

> How does women’s participation in rebel groups shape the fate of those
> groups at conflict’s end? While existing literature on the role of
> female rebels in civil war focuses on explaining why and how women
> rebel, less is known about their influence on rebel groups’ transition
> from combatants to electoral competitors. In this paper I argue
> women’s participation in combat during wartime increases the
> probability a rebel group transitions to a political party by altering
> the former combatant’s calculus regarding their chances for electoral
> success. Using data on rebel groups in civil wars ending between 1975
> and 2018, I employ a series of logistic regression models and Bayesian
> model averaging to evaluate my theoretical expectations. I find
> evidence rebel groups featuring female combatants during wartime are
> more likely to transition to political parties compared to those that
> did not, suggesting women’s participation in combat has a
> substantively meaningful impact post-conflict institutional
> development.
